# ReactNativeCurrency
I have built a currency converter application. This application helps to convert currency. 
When you enter a Euro value the applications converts to different currency unit.

Firstly i defined the currency types. They were EUR, JPY , TRY, USD, CAD. Later i used a library which is axios.
Axios is a client fort he browser and node.js and also we can use it for react native. I have installed axios by npm and i imported to my app.js file.
 
 Table-1 (installed axios)

 ## Data Extraction
 Then i used a website for data extraction which is data.fixer.io. This sites gives free api key for currency so i could use free api key.
